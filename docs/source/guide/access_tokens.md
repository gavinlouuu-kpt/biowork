Label Studio has personal access tokens and legacy tokens. These tokens are also referred to as your "API keys."

## Find your API keys

You can access your API keys by clicking your user icon in the upper right and selecting **Account & Settings**. 

If you do not see either the **Personal Access Tokens** or **Legacy Tokens** page, that means you first need to enable them for your organization.

## Enable API keys for an organization

The options that users see on their **Account & Settings** page depend on your settings at the organization level. 

From the **Organization** page, select **Settings > Access Token Settings**. 

<div class="enterprise-only">

!!! note
    The **Organization** page is only available to users in the Admin and Owner role.

</div>

From here you can enable and disable token types. 

* When a certain token type is disabled, existing tokens will not be able to authenticate to the Label Studio platform. 

* Use the Personal Access Token Time-to-Live to set an expiration date for personal access tokens. (Enterprise only)

## Personal access tokens

### SDK

Personal access tokens (API keys) can be used with the Python SDK the same way in which legacy tokens were set:

```python
# Define the URL where Label Studio is accessible and the API key for your user account
LABEL_STUDIO_URL = 'http://localhost:8080'
# API key is available at the Account & Settings > Access Tokens page in Label Studio UI
API_KEY = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9....'

# Import the SDK and the client module
from label_studio_sdk.client import LabelStudio

# Connect to the Label Studio API and check the connection
ls = LabelStudio(base_url=LABEL_STUDIO_URL, api_key=API_KEY)

```

### HTTP API

If you are interacting directly via HTTP, the personal access token functions as a JWT refresh token.

You must use your personal access token (refresh token) to generate a short-lived access token. This access token is then used for API authentication.

To generate this access token, make a POST request with your personal access token in the JSON body. For example:
     
```bash
curl -X POST <your-label-studio-url>/api/token/refresh \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"refresh": "your-personal-access-token"}'
```

In response, you will receive a JSON payload similar to:
     
```json
{
    "access": "your-new-access-token"
}
```

Use this access token by including it in your API requests via the Authorization header:
     
```http
Authorization: Bearer your-personal-access-token
```

When that access token expires (after around 5 minutes) youâ€™ll get a 401 response, and will need to use your personal access token again to acquire a new one. This adds an extra layer of security.

You can also check when the token is set to expire using the following script:

```python
# pip install pyjwt
from datetime import datetime, timezone
import jwt

decoded = jwt.decode(token)
exp = decoded.get("exp")
token_is_expired = (exp <= datetime.now(timezone.utc).timestamp())
```


## Legacy tokens

Generally speaking, the legacy tokens are not as secure as JWT because they must be manually revoked. 

However, they are easier to use with HTTP API (such as in `cUrl` commands) and required for use with the [Label Studio ML backend](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio-ml-backend).

Use this access token by including it in your API requests via the Authorization header:
     
```http
Authorization: Token your-legacy-token
```

!!! note
    Use `Token` with the legacy token and `Bearer` with the personal access token.
