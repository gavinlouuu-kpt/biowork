### Frequently asked Enterprise billing questions

Find answers to common questions related to billing. 

#### What happens if my plan is inactive?

If your subscription to Label Studio Enterprise expires or is cancelled, you can no longer perform labeling, review annotations, or add new users to your organization. You can log in and export your completed annotations. 

#### What happens if I have too many active users?

You need to purchase additional seats for your Label Studio Teams subscription if you have more active users than your subscription allows. A user counts as an active user when they are assigned a role. Invited users that have not yet accepted an invitation appear as "Not activated" and do not count toward the seat limit.

## Label Studio Starter Cloud

Label Studio Starter Cloud has the **Usage & Billing** page that shows information about your subscription and how many seats you have in use. 

!!! note
    Only the Organization owner can access the Usage & Billing page. 

There are two components to the subscription:

* **Base subscription** - This is your access to Label Studio Starter Cloud and includes 1 seat.
* **Additional seats** - You can purchase up to 11 additional seats (for a total of 12) on an as-needed basis.

### Manage seats

#### Add seats

As an Owner, go to **Organization > Usage & Billing**. Click **Manage Seats** and increase your seat count. 

When you add seats, the cost is prorated and is reflected on your next invoice. An organization can have up to 12 seats. 

#### Remove seats

Before you can remove seats, you must deactivate their associated users. You cannot have more active users than seats.

To deactivate a user, go to the **Organization > Members** page and set the user's role to **Deactivated**.
